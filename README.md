# Programming 2 -course project
This is the first project I did in terms of programming at uni and that might shine through here :D

All of the .txt files are what you "edit" with the program, they have some general metadata about the "image". There are a bunch of them for testing purposes, and it isn't very clean. Unlucky I guess.
It's quite simple, but at the time it was very instructive to make.
